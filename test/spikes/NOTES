NOTES
Using multiple Pipes
 - we can not create the Windows in the Node, which would have
 exclusive access to RenderingSystem and Ogre::Root.
	 -> Eather Ogre or Equalizer freezes if we call makeCurrent and create
	 Ogre RenderWindow.
 - Options:
 	- Create windows in eq::Windows, we need to use Mutexes for the
	Ogre::Root and RenderingSystem.
		-> seems to work perfectly.
		-> need to create an object and see if we can render also.
		-> problems :
			- Ogre::SceneManager serializes rendering calling Ogre::Root
				-> Try to create one sceneManager, multiple Windows and cameras
				and render serialy for now.
			- Something funny with DepthBuffer creation.
 	- Or write Ogre specific OSWindow to Equalizer e.g. OgreWindow
		-> This has some nice properties like beign not so much a hack.
		There should be ok support in Equalizer to replace OSWindow.
		We can use Ogres window creation to create Windows specified in 
		equalizer config. No need to use less used features of ogre like
		useCurrentContext.

Multiple Nodes
- Workaround for problems with Multiple Pipes.
- Need to add Ogre stuff to node_test.cpp so we can test it.
- Needs almost immediately fully working versioning.

Clients configurations :
Supports : multiple clients of same and different types
		   hostname and port configuration
		   trigger configuration for event handling system

At the moment only VRPN tracking client is supported

Trigger configuration :
Each Trigger node will create a trigger based on the node attributes.
Each trigger will send a message to the application event system
when it receives new data.

Errors :
critical errors invalidate this configuration, so it can not be used
they can either be delt in the application level by aborting or printing an error
message and continuing the execution, no data from invalid configuration can be
used in either case.

				Trigger is a event trigger invoked in the application when a new

				type is the trigger type created for this event for now the type

				Good convention if the data is received from a simulator is to
				match the name of the trigger to the name of the object or
				scene/object.
				This is not necessary but it's easier for the one who writes the

			NOTE Modifying the transformation is not implemented at the moment
			because the obvious way (using separate vectors for control) is
			too complex and confusing to the user, you can never be sure what is
			the order of the transformation and what parameters modify what values.

			The configuration interface needs to be well defined and easy to
			understand and verify.
			For example matrix multiplication is well defined though not easy
			or intuitive. Using a hierarchical transform node type of thing
			might be easier to use, or some predefined matrices for most likely
			use cases.

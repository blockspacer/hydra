	Defaults to all true.
	Only value "false" will set the axis out of use at the moment.

	Be vary of these as they affect how the scene looks but not the
	SceneNodes, so if the scene node is in some obscure rotation but these
	are set to false you might not be moving to the direction you think the
	camera is pointing at.

Test configuration used for development. Contains almost all the tokens
and usable values for them.
Does not contain the specification. Have a look at config/env.xml for that.

<env_config>

	<!-- Global rendering settings mostly used for developing new features
		 but also could be used for enabling disablin features for performance

		 @param type: How to render
		 possible values:
		 	FBO
			window
			deferred
		 default value: window

		 Using FBO surface will cause the renderer to first render all images

		 to FBO then copy them to the Window for displaying.
		 This allows the use of post processing effects and possibility
		 to render the images on another GPU (not supported yet).

		hardware_gamma use OpenGL gamma correction
		you should not disable this unless you know what you are doing
		gives more realistic lighting and materials but needs modifications
		to textures and scene lighting.

		 @todo
		 Seems like there is a hit of ~10% using the debug version when
		 rendering to FBO instead of directly to the screen. Not necessarily
		 significant in real projects, but something to keep an eye out for.
		 @todo
		 FBOs don't support stereo for now, we need to use two separate
		 FBOs for stereo (or alternativily two separate channels).
